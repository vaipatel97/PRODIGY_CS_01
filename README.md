# Caesar Cipher Tool

A simple Python-based tool to encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar cipher algorithm.

## 📜 About
The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. This tool allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages easily.

## 🚀 Features
- Encrypt text using a shift value
- Decrypt text with a known shift value
- Supports uppercase and lowercase letters
- Real-time encryption and decryption show results instantly.

## 🔧 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/vaipatel97/PRODIGY_CS_01.git
   cd caesar-cipher-tool
   ```
2. Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.x recommended).

## 🛠 Usage
Run the script using Python:
```sh
python caesar_cipher.py
```

### Example
#### Encryption:
```python
Enter text: Hello World
Enter shift value: 3
Encrypted text: Khoor Zruog
```

#### Decryption:
```python
Enter text: Khoor Zruog
Enter shift value: 3
Decrypted text: Hello World
```
## Usage
1. Encrypt:

Enter your plain text message in the "Enter your message" field.
Enter your shift value in input box.
Click on "Encrypt". 
A random key will be generated, and your encrypted message will be displayed instantly.

2. Decrypt:

Enter the encrypted message in the "Enter your message" field.
Enter your shift value in input box.
Click on "Decrypt" to reveal the original message.

## 📌 How It Works
The Caesar cipher works by shifting each letter of the message by a certain number of places in the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3:

'A' becomes 'D'
'B' becomes 'E'
'C' becomes 'F'
For decryption, the process is reversed using the correct key.

## 🛡 Security Considerations
- The Caesar cipher is not secure for modern encryption needs.
- It can be easily broken using frequency analysis or brute force attacks.
- Suitable for learning cryptography basics but not for protecting sensitive data.
