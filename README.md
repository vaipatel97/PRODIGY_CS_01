# Caesar Cipher Tool

A simple Python-based tool to encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar cipher algorithm.

## 📜 About
The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. This tool allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages easily.

## 🚀 Features
- Encrypt text using a shift value
- Decrypt text with a known shift value
- Supports uppercase and lowercase letters
- Real-time encryption and decryption show results instantly.

### 📖Manual/instruction for running code:

You can also download the pdf file to read the instructions, that has been uploaded.

# 🔧 Installation
### Requirements
- Python 3.x or higher
- Flask

### Steps to run: 
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/vaipatel97/PRODIGY_CS_01.git
   ```
2. Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.x recommended).

3. Run the script using Python:
```python     
python app.py
``` 

##  🛠 Usage
1. Encrypt:
- Enter your plain text message in the "Enter your message" field.
- Enter your shift value in the input box.
- Click on "Encrypt". 
- A random key will be generated, and your encrypted message will be displayed instantly.

2. Decrypt:
- Enter the encrypted message in the "Enter your message" field.
- Enter your shift value in the input box.
- Click on "Decrypt" to reveal the original message.

## 📌 How It Works

The Caesar cipher works by shifting each letter of the message by a certain number of places in the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3:

'A' becomes 'D'

'B' becomes 'E'

'C' becomes 'F'

For decryption, the process is reversed using the correct key.

## 🛡 Security Considerations

- The Caesar cipher is not secure for modern encryption needs.

- It can be easily broken using frequency analysis or brute force attacks.

- Suitable for learning cryptography basics but not for protecting sensitive data.
