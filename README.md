# Caesar Cipher Tool

A simple Python-based tool to encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar cipher algorithm.

## 📜 About
The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. This tool allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages easily.

## 🚀 Features
- Encrypt text using a shift value
- Decrypt text with a known shift value
- Supports uppercase and lowercase letters
- Real-time encryption and decryption show results instantly.

### Manual/instruction for running code:-->
1. Download the file.
2. Extract the file.
3. Open or run the command prompt or terminal as per your system.
4. Gave the path where you save the file in the command prompt or terminal.
   
   Example: cd users\desktop\.....
   
5. Then run the Python file in the command prompt or terminal.
   
   Example: python app.py
   
6. Then go to the folder where files have been extracted.
7. Click on the index.html file.
8. Your output will be visible in the browser, perform the tool.
9. You can also see the video to run the output.

# 🔧 Installation
### Requirements
- Python 3.x or higher
- Flask

### Steps to run: 
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/vaipatel97/PRODIGY_CS_01.git
   ```
2. Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.x recommended).\

3. Run the script using Python:
```python     
python app.py
``` 

##  🛠 Usage
1. Encrypt:
- Enter your plain text message in the "Enter your message" field.
- Enter your shift value in the input box.
- Click on "Encrypt". 
- A random key will be generated, and your encrypted message will be displayed instantly.

2. Decrypt:
- Enter the encrypted message in the "Enter your message" field.
- Enter your shift value in the input box.
- Click on "Decrypt" to reveal the original message.

## 📌 How It Works

The Caesar cipher works by shifting each letter of the message by a certain number of places in the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3:

'A' becomes 'D'

'B' becomes 'E'

'C' becomes 'F'

For decryption, the process is reversed using the correct key.

## 🛡 Security Considerations

- The Caesar cipher is not secure for modern encryption needs.

- It can be easily broken using frequency analysis or brute force attacks.

- Suitable for learning cryptography basics but not for protecting sensitive data.
